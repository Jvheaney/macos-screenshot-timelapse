# MacOS Screenshot Timelapse
This is just a small script to take screenshots on MacOS on an interval to later stitch together to make a timelapse.

You run it with `python timelapse.py {interval}`.

Interval is optional, default is 10s.

It uses no external libraries. I might add to this later to include the timelapse creation script. We'll see.
